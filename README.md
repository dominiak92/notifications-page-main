### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [LINK TO LIVE SITE](https://dominiak92.github.io/notifications-page-main/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to better arrange elements in HTML to make the code as optimized as possible. I used a single class for many elements. In JavaScript code, I perfected the ability to use forEach loops and work on functions. I learned more about how querySelectorAll works and how to convert it to a spread

### Continued development

I will try to further improve my basic JavaScript working skills, learn the basics and do such small projects. I noticed that forEach loops are very useful.
